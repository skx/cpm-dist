			     *** Installation ***

The 7.0 and later versions of DU  are designed to be installed with a  minimum
of trouble.  In fact,  in al- most  all cases, no changes  to the source  file
should be necessary to get DU up and running. This is because DU uses the disk
paramter  block  of  CP/M  to  determine  the  characteristics	of  the   disk
environment.  (see the dis- claimer for certain non-standard versions of  CP/M
1.4).

The only parameter that should need to be changed will be the clock speed flag
at 103H.  Leave this byte zero if you  have a 2 mhz clock.  Patch it  non-zero
for 4 mhz.  This is only needed for the "Z" (sleep) command.
:Logging and viewing disk parameters

L	Re-logs in the current disk.  You may pull out a  disk, put in a  new,
	and "L" just to log it in.

Lx	Logs in disk 'x', such as: LB

Ux	Logs user 'x' for next F command.  Gives '?' error if not CP/M version
	2.x.

#	Prints the disk parameters

Fname	Print directory  for  file "name",  then  positions to	its  directory
	sector. (Won't position under CP/M 2.x, but see = command below.)

M	Dumps a map of the group allocations for files.  Mn	Shows  which
	file is allocated to group "n".
:Positioning and reading

Tnn	Seek to track nn (no read)

Snn	Position to sector nn, and read

Gnn	Position to group nn and read.

G	Shows current position

=string	Ascii search, starting at current sector. <xx> hex may be imbedded, or
	used alone:  To find "IN 0FEH":   =<db><fe> Ignores bit 7 unless  <xx>
	is used.

+	advance 1 sector (if below track  2, this advances to next  numerical,
	if  2  or  >,  advances  based	on  CP/M's  normal  sector  scrambling
	algorithm, i.e. so + will get the next logical sector of the file

-	backs up 1 logical sector

Note + and - may take an amount:   for example, +F steps in 15 sectors.   Note
also that "-" issued at the first logical sector of the disk will wrap back to
the last.  Note "+"  issued at last sector will  wrap forward to  the first.

R	Reads the sector currently positioned  to into memory.	Note R	(Read)
	is implicit in	the G, +,  and - commands,  but N-O-T in  the S and  T
	commands (I did it because I was tired of disk reading after T command
	before I had a chance to issue the S command)

<	Saves current sector in a save buffer

>	Gets saved buffer.  < and  > may be used to  move a sector to  another
	place.
:Viewing data

V	Views the current sector.  (assumes ASCII data)

Vnn	Views nn sectors

D	Dump sector, hex + ASCII

A	Dump sector, ASCII only

H	Dump sector, hex only

Note all dump commands (D, A, H) may be optionally followed by a starting  and
ending address:

			D0,7F	is the same as just D
			D3,5
			A20,3F
:Altering data

CHaddr,val,val,val... change hex in sector

CAaddr,char string... change ASCII in sector

	NOTE that <xx> may be hex imbedded in the Ascii:  ca0,OK<d><a><1a>

	Use W to write changes  to disk.  Note that  the C command echoes  the
	overlaid data for verification.

CHaddr-addr,byte  or  CAaddr-addr,byte	repeats a change

W	Write back the	current sector	(N-O-T-E may not  be used  after an  F
	command, as CP/M was used to find the file in the directory
:Miscellanea

?	Gives command summary

N	Resets  CP/M via  the BDOS.   This may  make it  possible under  some
	implementations of  CP/M to  change the  disk format  (e.g.,  density,
	sides, etc)

X	Exit back to CP/M (Must press return).	Ctl-c was too easy to hit over
	modem lines, so I decided on 2-byte (X, CR) to exit.

P	Toggle printer switch on/off

Z	Sleep - causes the program to pause, such as to look at a dump.  Z  is
	1 sec.	Znn is nn tenths of a second on a 2 MHz 8080.

/	Repeats entire command.  Defaults or /nn	 to "forever".	NN  may
	be 2 to 65535
:Examples

Multiple commands may be separated by ";"

Any valid  command string  may be  placed as  an operand  of the  original  DU
command, i.e.:

			 A>DU G0;D;G2;=OK<D><A><1A>;D

Example: the following commands will erase the	b disk directory to all E5's:

	lb		log in b drive
	g0		position to dir.
	ch0-7f,e5	fill with e5
	<		save the sector
	>;w;+;/16	restore, write, next,
			repeat 16

This could be shortened to:

	lb;g0;ch0-7f,e5;<
	>;w;+;/16
:INTERPRETATION OF DIRECTORY DATA PRESENTED BY THE DU PROGRAM

The following explains the format  of a CP/M directory	entry as shown by  DU,
using either the  "F" (find file)  command, or	just doing "D"	(dump) of  the
directory sectors, which are  located in groups  0 and 1  on a single  density
disk. Sample result of "FSID.COM" command:

First	    40	00534944 20202020  20434F4D 0000003A  *.SID	COM...:*
