:Introduction
ZDASM  is  a  CP/M-based  Z80 disassembler which takes a  COM  file  and  an 
optional parameter file as input and produces an assembler-compatible source 
code  file  as  output.   The  parameter file is  read  by  ZDASM  prior  to 
processing the COM file.  Its format is given in a help message typed to the 
user  console by ZDASM.   The help message is accessed by running ZDASM with 
no command line parameters.   The format of the command line parameters used 
to cause ZDASM to disassemble a COM file is also given in the help  message.  
The COM file may be up to 64K in size.
:Command Format
The command format is:

       ZDASM  fname1<.COM>  <fname2<.Z80>>

where  fname2  defaults  to  fname1 if not given (both may  be  prefixed  by 
'device:' if desired).

A  parameter file will be produced automatically by ZDASM on the same  drive 
as  the COM file if one does not exist when ZDASM is invoked.   The  entries 
are  message data entries produced by scanning the COM file for  strings  of 
printable characters, CR, LF, TAB, NULL, and 0FFH.  If a string 8 characters 
or longer is found, it is flagged as a message.  The parameter file produced 
is  a printable ASCII file and may thus be scanned by the user and  modified 
for further disassembly passes using a text editor.
:Operation
ZDASM  makes  two passes through the COM file:  the first to set  up  label, 
subroutine, and usage tables, and the second to produce the source code.  In 
addition,  it  scans the parameter file to set up default table values prior 
to processing the COM file.   The COM file may be up to 64K in size and  any 
location  may  be labeled and/or set to indicate one of four types of  code: 
instructions,  message  data,  byte data,  and word data.   The  default  is 
instructions.   Message  data  indicates  that  DEFB directives  are  to  be 
produced with multiple bytes on one line (as many as will fit),  produced as 
either  quoted strings if printable or hexadecimal constants if  not.   Byte 
data produces DEFB directives with 1 byte per line.  Word data produces DEFW 
directives  with 1 word per line.   Instructions produce ZILOG-mnemonic  Z80 
source  code  statements.   Instructions  which are unique to  the  Z80  are 
generated with a comment flag ('tabtab;Z80') following the source code.

When  processing  instructions  in  pass  1,   operands  are  examined   for 
instruction  and data memory references.   For instruction references (calls 
and  relative and absolute jumps) the label map is set  appropriately.
~
For calls, the subroutine map is set to the destination address.  For  data Šreferences,  the  label map is set and also the usage map is set  to  either 
byte or word data, subject to the following rules:

 * Only  forward  references are  allowed  to flag locations as byte data or
   word  data  in  pass 1 so that locations already processed  will  not  be 
   changed.

 * Once a location is flagged as byte or word data by a memory reference, it
   will not be changed by following code.

 * If a location is flagged as byte, word, or message data by the  parameter
   file, it will not be changed by memory references.

For word constant register loads,  the label map is set.   The label may  be 
erroneous,  but  ZDASM cannot tell whether constants are addresses or  data, 
and  doing it this way allows the user to get a cross-referenced listing  of 
the  source code produced and determine the difference manually.   For  byte 
constant  register loads,  the constant is always treated as data;  the user 
will  have to examine to determine whether the data is actually  an  address 
LSB  or MSB.

The  contents of word data in the COM file is also used to create label  map 
entries during pass 1.

If  the last byte of a message is printable but with its msb  set,  DEFM  is 
produced instead of DEFB with the msb of the last character cleared.
:Parameter File Input
The PAR file must be on the same disk as the COM file;  this may be any disk 
(specified via A:,  B:,  etc) or the default disk if no device is specified.  
The Z80 file will be created on the same disk as the COM file (with the same 
base  name  and a .Z80 extension) if no output specification is given or  on 
any  disk if specified.   Extensions need not be specified on the  input  or 
output filenames,  however,  they will be used if given.   The default input 
file  extension  is COM and the default output file extension is  Z80.   The 
extension used for the parameter file is always PAR (and the same base  name 
as the input file).

Each  line of the parameter file contains a usage specification for a  range 
of addresses.  Later lines override earlier lines.  This fact may be used to 
decrease the number of lines in the parameter file in some cases (by setting 
a  block to one type,  then overwriting specific entries within  that  range 
with another type).

Leading  zeros are not required on hex addresses (trailing 'H' must  NOT  be 
included) in the parameter file.   All PAR file input may be mixed upper and 
lower case characters.   Many different characters may be used as delimiters 
before the hex addresses (space,  comma,  colon,  dash,  and tab).   The 1st 
character of each line must be a specification character, followed by either 
one  or two hex addresses (all separated by at least one delimiter).

If a pair of addresses are required, the 2nd need not be given if it is  theŠsame as the first (i.e., a 1-byte 'range' only requires one address).  Blank 
lines are allowable in the parameter file;  they are ignored.   Comments may 
be entered on any parameter file specification line following the  addresses 
(separated by at least 1 delimiter).  For example:

       M: 123-126      4-letter message: DEFB 'ABCD'
       B: 223-225      Three DEFB directives
       W: 103-106      Two DEFW directives
       L: 105          Label the 2nd DEFW

Word data specifications must indicate an even number of bytes.

All  addresses  in the parameter file are absolute memory  addresses  (i.e., 
where the file executes not where it loads).
:COM File Input
The  COM file is assumed to contain Z80 code/data ORGed to 100H.   If it  is 
desired  to  disassemble  code ORGed at some other  location  in  memory,  a 
parameter  file  may be created with an 'offset' entry giving  the  starting 
address.   If the program ends prior to the last location of the saved file, 
the end address may be given in the parameter file with an 'end' entry.  For 
example:

       O: 0            File is ORGed at absolute location 0
       E: 7F           and ends at absolute location 7F

The  offset given is used as the address following the END directive at  the 
end of the source code file output (this will be 100H if none given).
:Source File Output
Status information and file error conditions (r/w,  open,  close, and create 
errors) are reported to the user console.  Parameter file input is echoed to 
the console as processed.   Errors on parameter file input lines are printed 
following the line containing the error (before the CR/LF).

Source file output may optionally be directed to the console (via 'CRT:'  or 
'CON:') or to the printer (via 'LST:' or 'LPT:').  (Note, however, that tabs 
are not converted to spaces on output to non-file-structured devices).   All
output  from ZDASM is done through BDOS (no direct BIOS I/O),  so  control-P
(toggle  console output to printer),  control-S (start/stop console output), 
and control-C (return to CPM) are hooked up.   The present version of  ZDASM 
does not check for control-C directly, so to get control-C to work, you must 
stop console output via control-S, wait for it to stop, then type control-C.  
Note that control-C typed while stopped via control-S is handled directly by 
CPM;  thus  any output file opened by ZDASM will not be closed prior to  the 
return to the CPM prompt.

The user console need only handle CR,  LF, and upper/lower case (and tabs if 
output is to the console as explained above).

Byte data constants are output as operands in hex and are shown in quotes in 
the comments field if printable.
ŠAll  Z80-only  instructions are flagged with 'Z80' in  the  comments  field.  
There  are  always exactly 2 tabs prior to the ';' on any commented line  so 
that  the  Z80-only  flags may all be eliminated with a  text  editor  after 
disassembly:

       change "Z80 '"    to "'" in all
   then change "^I^I;Z80" to ""  in all

Labels  are  produced of the form 'Lnnnn:' where nnnn is the address of  the 
label.   Label  map entries are produced in pass 1 and deleted in pass 2  as
each  label  is  generated.   Any left over label map entries  are  used  to 
produce 'Lnnnn EQU 0nnnnH' directives prior to the END directive produced at 
the  end  of the source output.   Each EQU directive is commented  with  the 
usage type at the location pointed to (I=instructions,  B=byte data,  W=word 
data,  and  M=message data).   These will generally be pointers to byte  and 
word data areas outside the bounds of the COM file (if they are addresses).

Subroutines  (i.e.,  any  location  which  is  the  destination  of  a  CALL 
instruction)  is flagged by a ';***' comment line prior to the start of  the 
subroutine.
:Usage Notes
  -  Look in the Z80 output for labeled DEFB and DEFW directives followed by
     unlabeled instructions to find missed messages and tables.

  -  The Z80 file size is generally 6-8 times as large as the COM file

  -  If you don't wish ZDASM to create a parameter file (i.e., if you wish
     to force the entire file to be interpreted as instructions), you can
     'SAVE 0 fname.PAR' (prior to disassembly of fname.COM) which will take
     up no disk space (1 directory entry).  This is an easier way to create
     a null file than with a text editor.

~
     Once this is done however, one additional problem exists: word constant
     register load instructions.  These constants may be data or  addresses.
     ZDASM assumes they are addresses.  If they are  actually  data,  moving
     the destination will change the value of the constant.   Therefore, the
     user must examine all occurances of the following to  assure  that  the
     label refers to the referenced address:

                       LD      BC,Lnnnn
                       LD      DE,Lnnnn

     ZDASM assumes all byte values in instructions are data.  The user must
