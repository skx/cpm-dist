DX-Forth 1.0 is a full-featured Forth-83 compiler for all CP/M-80 
and Z-System users.

In addition to Forth's usual benefits - interactive testing, 
debugging and compilation - DX-Forth provides compact application 
generation, video functions (installable for most terminals), 
fast floating point and trigonometric functions, multi-tasking, 
overlays, automatic access to all CP/M user areas, Z-System 
support, Forth assembler and full source code.

Developed over several years, DX-Forth is the synthesis of what I 
always wanted in a CP/M Forth.  I hope you enjoy DX-Forth.
