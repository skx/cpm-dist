                  ------------------------------------

    In  spite  of all efforts,  some errors have found their way into
    the new TURBO 3.0 manual.    This file contains all the necessary
    corrections and additions, and we apologize for any inconvenience
    this may cause you.

    Please make a working  copy of your TURBO disk and store the ori-
    ginal in a safe  place.  For help  making a backup  copy,  please
    refer to appendix M of the TURBO PASCAL Reference Manual.

     The correct statement is:  MOV AL,[BP+4]

     Well - almost. The Real functions Sin, Cos, ArcTan, Ln, Exp,
     and Sqrt and the pre-declared constant Pi are not  available
     in  TURBOBCD.ä

User Written Error Handlers
---------------------------
     In  Turbo Pascal 3.0 you may write your own error  handler,
     which  is  called in case of an I/O or Run-time  error.  The
     procedure must have the following header:

          procedure Error(ErrNo, ErrAddr: Integer);

     The  name of the  procedure  and its  parameters  are  unim-
     portant,  as  long   as  it  is a procedure with  two  value
     parameters  of  type Integer.

     The value passed in ErrNo is the error type and number.  The
     most significant byte,  i.e. "Hi(ErrNo)", contains the error
     type,  and  the least significant byte,   i.e.  "Lo(ErrNo)",
     contains the error number (see Appendix F or G in the  Turbo
     Pascal Manual).

     The following error types are defined:

          0   User Break (Ctrl-C).
          1   I/O error.
          2   Run-time error.

     In  case  of  a user interrupt (Ctrl-C),   the low  byte  of
     "ErrNo" is always 1.  "ErrAddr" contains the address (offset
     in Code Segment for 16 bit versions) of the error.

     To  activate the error handler,   assign its offset  address
     to  the standard variable "ErrorPtr", i.e.

          ErrorPtr:=Ofs(Error);  { 16 bit }  or
          ErrorPtr:=Addr(Error); {  8 bit }

     There are no limits to what an error handler may  do.  Typi-
     cally  it will close all open files,   output an error  mes-
     sage, and call the Halt  standard procedure to terminate the
     program.   If  an  error handler returns,   i.e.  if it does
     not  call  Halt,   or  if an error occurs  within  an  error
     handler,   Turbo Pascal will itself output the error message
     and terminate the program.

                NEW FEATURES OF CP/M-80 IMPLEMENTATION OF
                                TURBO 3.0
                             - AN OVERVIEW -
                -----------------------------------------

Inline
------
     A constant identifier used in an INLINE statement does  not
     always generate two bytes of code.

Files
-----
     New FIB formats.
     Optional 4th parameter on Blockread/Write returns number of
       blocks actually read.
     SeekEoln function.
     SeekEof function.


Misc.
-----
     Exit procedure       -  To exit the current block
     OvrDrive procedure   -  To specify the drive on which to find overlays
     ParamCount function  -  Gives number of characters in the command buffer
     ParamStr function    -  Gives the string of characters in the command line

Overlays
--------

     Overlay  files  are  opened and closed every time  they  are
     accessed.  Therefore,  there is never a need to specifically
     close  an  overlay file.

     The  Y compiler directive is no longer  supported.  Instead,
     the   OvrPath (MS-DOS) or OvrDrive (CP/M)  standard   proce-
     dures   may  be  used to specify the drive and  subdirectory
     in which overlay files reside.

     Please note that run-time error F0 indicates that your over-
     lay file is missing or is called recursively.    (This error
     number is omitted from the Reference  Manual but is included
     elsewhere in this file.)
